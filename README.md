## ðŸš€ AUTO OWO  
- I run this code using Python.  
- I'm new to coding, so my code might not be the best.  
- You need to install Python to use my code.  
- This code runs on CMD (Command Prompt).  

## ðŸ”— Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
- Hope you guys find my code useful! :33
- Go to search and find cmd, and run the following commands:
- pip install pygetwindow pyautogui
- pip install thonny
- python -m thonny
- If you want to stop the code, just do Ctrl + C in cmd window

## ðŸ¤– ABOUT THE OWO BOT  
- The bot has a random check feature.  
- It can send a private check message to you or post directly in the channel where you're spamming.  
- Since it's random, please stay alert when the bot is running.  
- Running tools for owo is **against the rules**, so **please donâ€™t flex** or expose that you're using a tool.  
- The bot may suspect you of using a tool if you run it for an extended period.  
- Don't get too greedyâ€”overusing the tool **can get you permanently banned**   
  (and so far, no one has ever successfully appealed a ban).
